# Design a parking lot system.

A parking lot is an area where cars can be parked for a certain 
amount of time. A parking lot can have multiple floors with each
floor having a different number of slots and each slot being suitable
for different types of vehicles.

`We need to design a modern parking lot management system which can be managed without
any human intervention.` 

## Requirements :

    exiting.
4. Customers can pay the tickets at the automated exit panel or to the parking attendant.
5. Customer can pay using Card or Cash.

  the parking lot. If the parking is full, the system should be able to
  show a message at the entrance panel and on the parking display board 
  on the ground floor.
7. Each parking floor will have many parking spots. The system should support
    multiple types of parking spots such as Compact, Large, Handicapped, Motorcycle, etc.
8. The Parking lot should have some parking spots specified for electric cars.
    These spots should have an electric panel through which customers can pay and charge their vehicles.

    truck, van, motorcycle, etc.
